	"text": [ "AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network, designed by Alex Krizhevsky, and published with Ilya Sutskever and Krizhevsky's PhD advisor Geoffrey Hinton, who was originally resistant to the idea of his student. AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of GPUs during training. As of 2018, the Alexnet paper has been cited over 30,000 times."
